ALGORITHM: NUMBER GUESSING GAME

1. START
2. Initialize random seed using the current time.
3. Repeat the following steps (Main Menu Loop) until choice equals 4:
   a. Display difficulty menu:
      - 1 for Easy (1 to 50, 7 chances)
      - 2 for Medium (1 to 100, 5 chances)
      - 3 for Hard (1 to 200, 3 chances)
      - 4 to Exit
   b. Read user input into variable 'choice'.
   c. Check 'choice':
      - If 1: Set max = 50, chances = 7
      - If 2: Set max = 100, chances = 5
      - If 3: Set max = 200, chances = 3
      - If 4: Print exit message and exit loop.
      - If invalid: Print error, skip the rest of the loop, and ask again.
   d. Generate a random 'number' between 1 and 'max'.
   e. Set 'attempts' = 0.
   f. Repeat the following steps (Game Loop) while 'attempts' < 'chances':
      i. Prompt user to enter a 'guess' (or -1 to quit).
      ii. Read user input into variable 'guess'.
      iii. If guess == -1: Print quit message revealing the number and exit inner loop.
      iv. Increment 'attempts' by 1.
      v. If guess == number: Print success message with attempts and exit inner loop (Win).
      vi. Else if guess < number: Print "Too low! Try again."
      vii. Else: Print "Too high!! Try again."
      viii. If attempts == chances AND guess != number: Print "Game Over" message revealing the number (Loss).
4. END
