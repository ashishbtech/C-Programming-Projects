ALGORITHM:

1. START

2. Generate a random number between 1 and 100
   Store it in variable "secretNumber"

3. Declare variables:
      integer guess
      integer attempts ← 0

4. Repeat until guess == secretNumber:

   a. Ask user to enter a number
   b. Read value into "guess"
   c. Increment attempts by 1

   d. If guess == secretNumber
         Print "Congratulations! You guessed the correct number."
         Print "Total Attempts: ", attempts
         Exit loop

      Else if guess < secretNumber
         Print "Too Low! Try a bigger number."

      Else
         Print "Too High! Try a smaller number."

5. END
